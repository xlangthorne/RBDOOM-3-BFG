TBD - RBDOOM-3-BFG 1.5.0
_______________________________

## .plan - April 18, 2023

Stephen Saunders contributed support for borderlesss fullscreen mode which can also be set by commandline with r_fullscreen -2. It's enabled automatically if you switch from windowed mode to fullscreen by using Alt + Enter. You can’t tell the difference visually. However, stick to borderless mode over fullscreen mode if you use multiple monitors. 
You can access your displays and launch various apps while your game or work stays on the main display.

This has the advantage that you can better run RBDOOM-3-BFG simultanously along with TrenchBroomBFG, Blender, Krita or any other gamedev weapon of choice.

But, there is a downside to borderless mode, depending on your device. 
Most operating systems like Windows, for example, will continue dedicating resources to all background processes. 
This means you might get less performance and experience input lag if you’re running a game or a demanding app. 
If you need to squeeze some extra FPS, go back to real fullscreen mode to see if it makes a difference.

The glTF2 importer has been rewritten to make it more robust. The -transermotion option might not work.
The importer has still some bugs left like -scale only works on certain models.
It is not necessary anymore to specify the name of the armature node. 
It will automatically find the rig node but the exported .glb model should have only one skeleton.

The rest was cleaning up the code and removing unused OpenGL and Vulkan code.

Changelog:

* Support Borderless Fullscreen and Borderless Window modes for Win32 and SDL platforms

* Fixed recursive mesh adding in findEntities for glTF2 scenes

* Changed animated glTF2 models to be cached like MD5 meshes so model overlays work on them

## .plan - Nov 20, 2022

This build based on the 635-nvrhi5 branch allows to play the game with the NVRHI Vulkan backend.
You can switch to Vulkan by starting the engine with +set r_graphicsAPI vulkan.

Also this build is for testing Vulkan it seems that the current changes make RBDOOM-3-BFG the fastest version ever with DX12.

Special thanks to Steven Pridham and Steve Saunders to get this running on Linux and macOS.

For the overall NVRHI state see the task board: https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/projects/8

Besides that TrenchBroomBFG comes with a few fixes. The icon size option also affects the entity inspector now which helps with high resolutions.

## .plan - Oct 1, 2022

This build based on the 635-nvrhi3 branch repairs the loading of animated glTF2 models (thanks to Harrie van Ginneken) and an updated version of TrenchBroom.
All models need to be reexported by Blender using the enabled +Y Up option.

Models are expected to be exported by Blender with the following settings:

```
Format: glTF Binary (.glb)
Transform: +Y Up On
Materials: Export
Images: None
Compression: Off
Data: Custom Properties On
Animation: Animation On, Shape Keys On, Skinning On
```

Changelog:

* Added new Imgui Aritulated Figure editor by Stephen Pridham (forgot to mention this in the last Changelog)

* Fixed math problem and transposed idMat4::ToMat3()

* Repaired glTF2 skeletal animations for the Y-Up case

* Fixed glTF2 boneless TRS animations

* Fixed dmap .glb world+entity geom for the Y-Up case

* Renormalize normals & tangents from dmap .glb import

* Fixed random Unknown punctuation error while loading a glTF2 model

* Transform entity geometry for dmap -glview .obj output into world space

* Moved BSP visualization into separate dmap -asciiTree option

* Renamed custom TrenchBroom fork to TrenchBroomBFG

* Change TrenchBroomBFG to only load Doom 3 related game profiles as it breaks compatibility to other Quake based games

* TrenchBroomBFG was updated with the latest TrenchBroom/master code which involves a couple of bugfixes for linked groups (instancing)

* If you turn off certain brushes like visportals in the View Options you won't accidently select by clicking to brushes behind them



## .plan - Sep 25, 2022

This build based on the 635-nvrhi3 branch improves the glTF2 support for mapping with Blender and adds back OGG Vorbis support for custom soundtracks.

Models are expected to be exported by Blender with the following settings:

Format: glTF Binary (.glb)
Transform: +Y Up Off <-- BIG CHANGE: it was On last time
Materials: Export
Images: None
Compression: Off
Data: Custom Properties On

Similar to modern Quake sourceports users can now just throw their favorite soundtrack into base/music/ like base/music/aqm/*.ogg or into a modfolder/music/ path.
The game will play automatically it in the background as a looping track until the end of the map.
Each map will pick a different track but mappers can also define a "music" track in the worldspawn entity.
You can also fine tune the volume of each track if you write a sound shader for your files.

There is an example in mod_alternativequakemusic/sound/_rbdoom_aqm_tracks.sndshd for the Alternative Quake Music sound track.

Changelog:

* Improved Quake .map converter to get Makkon's samplemaps working

* Tweaked dmap -glview option to dump an .obj next to the .proc file with similar content and to print an ASCII art BSP tree in the proc file

* Bumped the required C++ standard to C++14

* TrenchBroom's  glTF2 support was changed to properly display models that were exported from Blender with the +Y-Up option ticked OFF

* Added ancient oggvorbis code from vanilla Doom 3

* Merged Ogg Vorbis support from DNF id Tech 4 branch (thanks to Justin Marshall for making .ogg working with the BFG sound engine)

* Scan for music/*.ogg files and play a different track for each map

* You can start the Vulkan backend with +set r_graphicsAPI Vulkan

* Fixed several Vulkan related bugs like the swapchain problem. It is not playable yet

* The Icedhellfire mod contains AAS files for the ROE maps

## .plan - Sep 04, 2022

This build based on the 635-nvrhi3 branch adds glTF2 support to RBDOOM-3-BFG and TrenchBroom.
Big thanks to Harrie van Ginneken (VrKnight) for contributing this major feature.
The glTF2 support doesn't rely on thirdparty loaders and is a native id Tech 4x implementation.

Material names in Blender need to be 1:1 the material names defined in the corresponding materials/*.mtr files.

Models are expected to be exported by Blender with the following settings:

Format: glTF Binary (.glb)
Transform: +Y Up
Materials: Export
Images: None
Compression: Off
Data: Custom Properties On

Changelog:

* Added glTF2 model loader for static and animated models

* Changed dmap to support compiling maps from gtTF2 .glb models instead of .map files

* Added support for MapPolygonMeshes to the AAS compiler

* TrenchBroom uses Assimp for glTF2 support and is based on branch doom3-support9 using TB/master from Jul 06, 2022

This build also gives a preview of the Iced Hellfire Mod by Justin Marshall (icecoldduke):
It features native weapon and monster AI implementations in C++ and Quake 3 multiplayer bots.
I added a couple of bugfixes and compiled the deathmatch maps with runAAS so you can try the multiplayer bots with the "fillbots" command.

The directory "mod_icedhellfire" contains the necessary updated AAS files for the multiplayer maps.
In order to play the mod you only need to start DoomIcedHellfire.exe without extra parameters.

## .plan - Jul 03, 2022

This build targets several problems when using the bakeEnvironmentProbes and bakeLightGrid commands using the NVRHI/DX12 backend.
So the commands are producing the same results as the OpenGL backend now.

* Don't use TAA jitter when capturing env probes!

* Always clear the envprobe FBO for lightgrid capturing

* Print engine version when starting to write a qconsole.log

* Fixed window icon by adding the missing doom.rc

## .plan - Jun 27, 2022

This build targets several problems when compiling maps with dmap and it adds GPU Skinning to the DX12 backend.

* Merged GPU skinning code by SP and did additional refactoring

* Don't generate collision models for every rendermodel in advance. Restored vanilla Doom 3 behaviour.

* Dmap: always write a .cm file, especially when overwriting from a mod dir

* Support the Valve 220 texture projection in MapPolygonMesh::ConvertFromBrush()

* Automatically remove map collision .cm, .bcm files before running dmap

* Crashfix: Don't refesh the screen using prints during engine shutdown

## .plan - Jun 5, 2022

This build targets the NVRHI/DX12 crash problems that have been reported since the last build.

* Fixed rendering of FFmpeg, Binkdec videos and Doomclassic modes #648 677

* Separate bind set for material textures in the light passes to avoid allocation problems #676

* Fixed chromatic aberration on right/bottom screen corners

## .plan - May 29, 2022

This version replaces OpenGL with DX12 using the NVRHI API.

NVRHI (NVIDIA Rendering Hardware Interface) is a library that implements a common abstraction layer over multiple graphics APIs (GAPIs): Direct3D 11, Direct3D 12, and Vulkan 1.2. It works on Windows (x64 only) and Linux (x64 and ARM64).

The initial port to NVRHI and major work was done by Stephen Pridham. Big thanks for that!

* Renderer uses DX12 instead of OpenGL. Vulkan isn't supported yet

* SMAA has been replaced with a Temporal Anti Aliasing solution by Nvidia. This not only fixes geometric aliasing but also shader based aliasing like extreme specular highlights by the PBR shaders.

* The MSAA option is gone for the moment

* Shadow mapping uses a fat shadowmap atlas instead of switching between shadowmap buffers and the HDR render target for each light

* Shaders are not compiled at runtime anymore. They are compiled in advance by CMake using the DXC shader compiler and distributed in binary form under base/renderprogs2/dxil/*.bin

* All shaders have been rewritten to proper HLSL

## .plan

This version improves support for mapping with TrenchBroom. Until now you needed to extract and copy the vanilla Doom 3 models and textures over to the base/ folder to see the content in the TrenchBroom entity browser and texture viewer.
Owning the original game next to the BFG edition is not necessary anymore.
This version comes with a couple of new RBDOOM-3-BFG console commands that lets you export particular parts of the .resources files to the base/_tb/ folder.

You need to call exportImagesToTrenchBroom once and you are good to go to start mapping with the TrenchBroom level editor.

TrenchBroom comes with several more Doom 3 specific changes. After loading a map TrenchBroom generates unique entity names and also fixes missing or bad "model" keys for brush based entitites.
Also creating new entities like light will automatically receive names like light_2.

This patch also contains a couple of func_group related bugfixes. func_group works now with brush based entities, point entities and just regular brushes.

## Changelog

[TRENCHBROOM]

* Tweaked exportFGD command for new icons

* Added new icons to TrenchBroom for certain entities like lights, speakers or particle emitters

* TrenchBroom offers a dropdown menu to select the Quake 1 light style for lights

* Drastically improved loading time of textures for materials in TrenchBroom

* Added RBDoom console command convertMapToValve220 `<map>`. You can also type `exec convert_maps_to_valve220.cfg` to convert all Doom 3 .map files into the TrenchBroom friendly format. Converted maps are saved with the _valve220.map suffix.

* Added RBDoom console command exportImagesToTrenchBroom which decompresses and saves all .bimage images to base/_tb/*.png files

* Added RBDoom console command exportModelsToTrenchBroom which saves all .base|.blwo|.bmd5mesh models to _tb/*.obj proxy files. This commands also generates helper entities for TrenchBroom so all mapobject/models are also available in the Entity Inspector using the DOOM-3-models.fgd.

* Added RBDoom console command makeZooMapForModels which makes a Source engine style zoo map with mapobject/models like .blwo, .base et cetera and saves it to maps/zoomaps/zoo_models.map. This helps mappers to get a good overview of the trememdous amount of custom models available in Doom 3 BFG by sorting them into categories and arranging them in 3D. It also filters models so that only modular models are picked that can be reused in new maps.

* TrenchBroom got several Doom 3 specific issue generators to help mappers avoiding pitfalls during mapping

* Changed TrenchBroom's rotation tool to use the "angles" key by default to remove some Quake related limitations


[MISCELLANEOUS]

* Stencil shadows work again (thanks to Stephen Pridham) 

* Fixed black screen after using the reloadImages command

* Added CMake options STANDALONE and DOOM_CLASSIC

* Added command convertMapQuakeToDoom `<map>` that expects a Quake 1 .map in the Valve220 format and does some Doom 3 specific fixes

* The gamecode ignores func_group entities if they were created by TrenchBroom instead to warn that there is no spawn function

* dmap / idMapFile move brushes of func_group entities to worldspawn before compiling the BSP. 
  This also means func_group brushes are structural. 
  If you want to optimize the BSP then move those to func_static instead which is the same as func_detail in Quake.
  
* Fixed that dmap failed writing the BSP .proc file if the command was interrupted by an error

[COMMUNITY]

Steve Saunders contributed

* Updated mac OS support

* Improved Vulkan / Molten support

* Fixed FFmpeg 5 compatibility for newer Linux distros

* Bink videos can play audio if they contain audio tracks (merged from DOOM BFA by Mr.GK)


[ASSETS]

* Added TrenchBroom helper entityDefs like a Quake 3 style misc_model to comply with TrenchBroom's Solid/PointClass rules for editing entities

* Added new Creative Commons CC0 textures/common/ and textures/editor/ replacement textures because they didn't ship with the BFG edition

* Added base/convert_maps_to_valve220.cfg which lets you convert all maps to the Valve 220 .map format in one shot

* Added base/maps/zoomaps/zoo_models.map

# RBDOOM-3-BFG 1.3.0 adds PBR, Baked GI and TrenchBroom Mapping Support

The main goal of this 1.3.0 release is enabling modders the ability to make new content using up to date Material & Lighting standards. Adding PBR is a requirement to make the new content look the same in RBDOOM-3-BFG as in Blender 2.9x with Cycles or Eevee and Substance Designer. PBR became the standard material authoring since 2014. Many texture packs for Doom 3 like the Wulfen & Monoxead packs were made before and are heavily outdated. With this release modders can work with modern tools and expect that their content looks as expected.

However the PBR implementation is restricted to standard PBR using the Roughness/Metallic workflow for now.
Specialized rendering paths for skin, clothes and vegetation will be in future releases.

## Physically Based Rendering

Implementing Physically Based Rendering (PBR) in Doom 3 is a challenge and comes with a few compromises because the Doom 3 content was designed to work with the hardware constraints in 2004 and that even meant to run on a Geforce 3.

The light rigs aren't made for PBR but it is possible to achieve good PBR lighting even with the old content by tweaking the light formulars with a few good magic constants. However I also want to support the modding scene to allow them to create brand new PBR materials made with Substance Designer/Painter or other modern tools so multiple rendering paths have been implemented.

PBR allows artists to create textures that are based on real world measured color values and they look more or less the same in any renderer that follows the PBR guidelines and formulars.

***RBDOOM-3-BFG only supports the standard PBR Roughness/Metallic workflow.***

## Baked Global Illumination using Irradiance Volumes and Image Based Lighting

*To achieve the typical PBR look from an artistic point of view it also means to that it is necessary to add indirect lighting.
Doom 3 and even Doom 3 BFG had no indirect lighting.*

Doom 3 BFG is a big game. Doom 3, Resurrection of Evil and Lost Missions sum up to 47 big single player levels with an average of ~60 - 110 BSP portal areas or let's call them rooms / floors. Each room can have up to 50 shadow casting lights and most of them are point lights.
I needed a good automatic solution that fixes the pitch black areas without destroying the original look and feel of the game.
I also needed to add environment probes for each room so PBR materials can actually reflect the environment.

So RBDOOM-3-BFG comes with 2 systems to achieve this and both are automatic approaches so everything can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time.
The first system are environment probes which are placed into the center of the rooms. They can also be manually tweaked by adding env_probe entities in the maps. They use L4 spherical harmonics for diffuse reflections and GGX convolved mip maps for specular reflections.
The second system refines this by using a light grid for each room which provides a sort of a localized/improved version of the surrounding light for each corner of the room.

### Irradiance Volumes aka Light Grids

RBDOOM-3-BFG 1.3.0 brings back the Quake 3 light grid but this time the grid points feature spherical harmonics encoded as octahedrons and it can be evaluated per pixel. This means it can be used on any geometry and serves as an irradiance volume.
Unlike Quake 3 this isn't radiosity which is limited to diffuse only reflections. The diffuse reflectivity is built using all kinds of incoming light: diffuse, specular and emissive (sky, light emitting GUIs, VFX).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DKoBaP6.png" width="384"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Yrhh28g.png" width="384">

Lightgrids can be baked after loading the map and by typing:

```
bakeLightGrids [<switches>...]
<Switches>
 limit[num] : max probes per BSP area (default 16384)
 bounce[num] : number of bounces or number of light reuse (default 1)
 grid( xdim ydim zdim ) : light grid size steps into each direction (default 64 64 128)
```

This will generate a ***.lightgrid*** file next to your .map file and it will also store a light grid atlas for each BSP area under ***env/maps/<path/to/your/map/>***

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HeXnVLs.jpg" width="640">

Limit is 16384 by default and means the maximum number of light grid points in a single light grid.
Quake 3 had one light grid that streched over the entire map and distributed lighting every 64 x 64 x 128 units by default.
If the maps were too big then q3map2 made the default grid size broader like 80 x 80 x 144, 96 x 96 x 160 and so on until the maximum number of light grid points was reached.

The Quake 3 approach wouldn't work with Doom 3 because the maps are too big and it would result in up to 800k probes for some maps or the grid density would very coarse.

RBDOOM-3-BFG uses the bounding size of the BSP portal areas and puts smaller light grids into those BSP areas.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pTR06dH.png" width="640">

This way we can maintain a good grid density and avoid wasting storage because of light grid points that are in empty space.

> But what is an Irradiance Volume or Light Grid exactly?

It tells each model or lit pixel how the indirect diffuse lighting is coming from any direction. The Probulator page by Yuri O'Donnell has some good examples:

Left: The captured view using a panorama layout. Right: The Diffuse lighting using Level 4 Spherical Harmonics aka Irradiance.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4i52c4k.png" width="384"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qq2HYuK.png" width="384">

Now think of this for each of the grid points in RBDOOM-3-BFG. If a model is placed between those probes the lighting will be interpolated by the nearest 8 grid points similar like in Quake 3.

Quake 3 only stored the dominant light direction, the average light color of that direction and an ambient color term for each grid point.
In RBDOOM-3-BFG you basically can have the diffuse lighting information for **any** world space direction instead.
This is a way more advanced technique.

### Image Based Lighting and Environment Probes

Environment probes supplement the light grids. While light grids provide diffuse lighting information the signal isn't good enough to provide plausible specular light reflections. This is where environment probes are needed.

If a level designer doesn't put any env_probe entities into a map then they are automatically distributed through the map using the BSP area bounds and placed in the center of them.

Environment probes can be computed after loading the map and by typing:
```
bakeEnvironmentProbes
```

This will generate EXR files in ***env/maps/<path/to/your/map/>***.

The environment probes use an octahedron encoding and the specular mipmaps are convolved using the Split Sum Approximation by Brian Karris [Epic 2013]. Convolving the environment probes is done on the CPU using the id Tech 5 multi threading code so it will consume all your available cores.

For artists this basically means if you increase the roughness in your material then you increase the mip map level of the environment probe it samples light from and it gets blurier.

### Fallback for Missing Data

If you haven't downloaded the additional baked light data from the [RBDOOM-3-BFG ModDB Page](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rbdoom-3-bfg) and just run RBDOOM-3-BFG.exe with the required DLLs (or you built it yourself) it will use an internal fallback.
RBDOOM-3-BFG.exe has one prebaked environment probe that is compiled into the executable.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q9ONWaq.jpg" width="384"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tM0aEIV.png" width="384"> 

It's the light data from the Mars City 1 lobby in the screenshot above. Using this data for the entire game is inacurrate but a better compromise than using a fixed global light direction and some sort of Rim lighting hack like in version 1.2.0.
The default irradiance / radiance data gives the entire game a warmer look and it fits for being on Mars all the time.


### Some Examples of Indirect Lighting

## PBR Texture format

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/j8nYYls.png" width="640">

In Doom 3 a classic simple materials looks like this:
```
textures/base_wall/snpanel2rust
{
  qer_editorimage		textures/base_wall/snpanel2rust.tga
	
  bumpmap           textures/base_wall/snpanel2_local.tga
  diffusemap        textures/base_wall/snpanel2rust_d.tga
  specularmap       textures/base_wall/snpanel2rust_s.tga
}
```

It's usually rendered with Blinn-Phong specular with a fixed specular exponent.
Specularmaps are more or less Gloss maps.

In RBDOOM-3-BFG it uses the PBR GGX Cook-Torrence formular and you can vary the roughness along the material like in other modern engines and you usually define a texture with the _rmao suffix.

RMAO Image Channels             | Description
:-----------------------------  | :------------------------------------------------
Red                             | Roughness
Green                           | Metalness
Blue                            | Ambient Occlusion

Example material:
```
models/mapobjects/materialorb/orb
{
  qer_editorimage   models/mapobjects/pbr/materialorb/substance/metal04_basecolor.png
  
  basecolormap      models/mapobjects/pbr/materialorb/substance/metal04_basecolor.png
  normalmap         models/mapobjects/pbr/materialorb/substance/metal04_normal.png
  specularmap       models/mapobjects/pbr/materialorb/substance/metal04_rmao.png
}
```

The engine will also look for _rmao.[png/tga] overrides for old materials and if it finds those it will render them using a better PBR path. Old school specularmaps also go through a GGX pipeline but the roughness is estimated from the glossmap.

The Ambient Occlusion will be mixed with the Screen Space Ambient Occlusion and will only affect indirect lighting contributed by the environment probes.

## Filmic Post Processing

TL;DR If you enable it then you play DOOM 3 BFG with the optics of a Zack Snyder movie.

This release adds chromatic abberation and filmic dithering using Blue Noise.
The effect is heavy and is usually aimed in Film production to mix real camera footage with CG generated content.

Dithering demonstration: left side is quantized to 3 bits for each color channel. Right side is also only 3 bits but dithered with chromatic Blue Noise. The interesting fact about the dithering here is shown in the upper debug bands.
The first top band is the original signal. The second shows just 8 blocks and if you dither the those blocks with Blue Noise then it is close to the original signal which is surprising.

## TrenchBroom Mapping Support

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tIj6wpd.jpg" width="640">

***This is still very much Work in Progress and not supported by the official TrenchBroom.***

Mapping for Doom 3 using TrenchBroom requires an extended unofficial build that is bundled with the official RBDOOM-3-BFG 7z package.
You can find the customized version under tools/trenchbroom/.

Doom 3 also requires some extensions in order to work with TrenchBroom. I usually develop these things for RBDOOM-3-BFG but I created a seperated brach for vanilla Doom 3 so everybody can adopt TrenchBroom and the new Doom 3 (Valve) .map support.

https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/DOOM-3/tree/506-TrenchBroom-interop

The goal of the TrenchBroom support is to make it easier to create new maps. It doesn't allow to create bezier patches at the moment so you won't be able to edit existing Doom 3 maps.

You can only save maps to the Doom 3 Valve format but you can copy paste from the vanilla Doom 3 .map format into the Doom 3 (Valve)configuration and reset your texture alignment as you want.
TrenchBroom doesn't support brush primitives like in D3Radiant or DarkRadiant and if you are familiar with TrenchBroom then you know that the preferred .map format is some kind of (Valve) .map format for your game.

The Quake 1/2/3 communities already adopted the Valve .map format in the BSP compilers and I did the same with dmap in RBDOOM-3-BFG.

Here is an overview of the changes made to TrenchBroom:

***New***
* Doom 3 .map parser with brushDef3, patchDef2, patchDef3 primitives
* Doom 3 Valve .map configuration
* Quake 3 .shader parser adopted to support .mtr
* .mtr support includes support for Doom 3 diffuse stages and the lookup for them is like in idMaterial::GetEditorImage()
* New Doom 3 OBJ parser. My TB Interop branch automatically creates OBJ files to work with TB and it also allows seamless interop with Blender 2.8x and 2.9x with the need of additional model formats for func_static entities (like misc_model for Quake 3)
* Game FGDs for Doom 3 and Doom 3 BFG

***Issues***
* It has no support for BFG .resource files and .bimage files. BFG only shipped for precompressed textures and no .tga files so people who want to mod for BFG have to copy the vanilla D3 base/textures/* and base/models/* to D3BFG/base/
* Many entities work differently in Doom 3 if they have an origin. Brush work in D3 is usually stored in entity space and not world space. This is a major issue and not solved. I couldn't figure out how to parse the origin first and then translate the brushes accordingly.
* Doom 3's primary model formats are LWO and ASE. LWO and .md5mesh model support is missing.
* Some ASE models can't be loaded and materials are usually all wrong if loaded

## General Changelog

[PBR]

* r_useHDR 1 is now the default mode and can't be turned off because it is a requirement for Physically Based Rendering

* Changed light interaction shaders to use PBR GGX Cook-Torrance specular contribution. The material roughness is estimated by the old school Doom 3 glossmap if no PBR texture is provided

* PBR texture support

* Extended ambient pass to support Light Grids and Environment Probes

* Turned off Half-Lambert lighting hack in favor of Image Based Lighting

* Improved r_hdrDebug which shows F-stops like in Filament

* Turned off r_hdrAutomaticExposure by default because it caused too much flickering and needs further work. The new default values work well with all Doom 3 content

* r_lightScale (default 3) can be changed

* Light shaders were tweaked with magic constants that r_forceAmbient 0.5, r_exposure 0.5 look as bright as in Doom 2016 or any other PBR renderer

* SSAO only affects the ambient pass and not the direct lighting and the ambient occlusion affects the specular indirect contribution depending on the roughness of a material. See moving Frostbite to PBR (Lagarde2014)

* Added HACK to look for PBR reflection maps with the suffix _rmao if a specular map was specified and ends with _s.tga. This allows to override the materials with PBR textures without touching the material .mtr files.

* Fixed ambient lights, 3D GUIs and fog being too bright in HDR mode

* Fixed darkening of the screen in HDR mode when you get hit by an enemy

* Fixed ellipse bug when using Grabber gun in HDR mode #407

* Added LoadEXR using TinyEXR, LoadHDR using stb_image

* Optimized R_WriteEXR using TinyEXR compression

* Added Spherical Harmonics math from Probulator by Yuri O'Donnell

* Added Octahedron math by Morgan McGuire - http://jcgt.org/published/0003/02/01/

[VULKAN]

* **NOTE THE VULKAN BACKEND IS STILL NOT FINISHED!!!**

* Fixed GPU Skinning with Vulkan

* Fixed the lighting with stencil shadows with Vulkan and added Carmarck's Rerverse optimization

[TRENCHBROOM]

* idMapFile and dmap were changed to support the Valve 220 .map format to aid mapping with TrenchBroom

* Added exportFGD [models] console command which exports all def/*.def entityDef declarations to base/exported/_tb/ as Forge Game Data files. TrenchBroom has native support to read those files https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/FGD.
Using the models argument will also export all needed models by entity declarations to base/_tb/ as Wavefront OBJ files.

* To make it easier getting static models from Blender/Maya/3D Studio Max into TrenchBroom and the engine Wavefront OBJ model support has been ported from IcedTech

* Support ***angles*** keyword again for TrenchBroom like in Quake 3

[MISCELLANEOUS]

* com_showFPS bigger than 1 uses ImGui to show more detailed renderer stats like the original console prints with r_speeds

* Removed 32bit support: FFmpeg and OpenAL libraries are only distributed as Win64 versions, 32bit CMakes files are gone

* Added Blue Noise based Filmic Dithering by Timothy Lottes and Chromatic Aberration

October 2019 - RBDOOM-3-BFG 1.2.0
_______________________________

This is a maintenance release without Vulkan support even though it contains a lot Vulkan specific code.

* Experimental Work in Progress Vulkan renderer backend based on Dustin Land's Doom 3 BFG Vulkan port
  This renderer backend only supports ambient lighting and no light interactions but it also comes with a big renderer code cleanup.

  The changes also fixed several rendering bugs that occured in OpenGL:
  
* Fixed black dots when HDR and SSAO is enabled

* Hit/damage markers show a white background #422

* Refactored and simplified OpenGL renderer backend to match Vulkan backend

* Renamed the .vertex and .pixel shader files to .hlsl
  This allows better editing of the shaders within Visual Studio including Intellisense support.

* Added in-engine Flash debugging tools and new console variables.
  These tools help to analyse the id Tech view of Flash and what SWF tags are supported and how they are interpreted
  by id Tech's own ActionScript 2 interpreter
	- postLoadExportAtlas
	- postLoadExportSWF
	- postLoadExportJSON
	- swf_show : Draws the bounding box of instanced Flash sprites in red and their names

* Added Steel Storm 2 Engine render demo fixes
